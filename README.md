# Titanic Passenger Data Cleaning and Trends Analysis- Report

## Task
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

### Steps followed 
- Step 1 : Loading of data into Power BI Desktop software tool, by sourcing the data from the Titanic dataset, which is readily available in the Kaggle website.
- Step 2 : Opening of power query editor to create tables and edit them, based on the cleaning and analysis requirement. 
- Step 3 : The several tables created in Power BI for this project include PassengerId, Surname, Sex, Age, Survived, Embarked, Fare and Pclass.
- Step 4 : Based on the given dataset, a few additional tables like Family On-board and Marital Status have also been created.
- Step 5 : As soon as the tables were created, the data cleaning and EDA processes have been performed. This consists of multiple steps, such as eliminating null values from tables and splitting of columns to promote data organization. In this project, various columns like Embarked, Age, etc. have been eliminated of null values. Also, passenger name has been split into two columns- First Name and Surname.
- Step 6 : A plethora of graphs have been plotted to ensure detailed data analysis. These graphs help to establish relationships between the various tables and their variables, which leads to well-detailed and highly informative data analysis.   
- Step 7 : Formatting of the visuals supports quicker data analysis. It aids in spotting patterns and understanding trends in the data at a much faster rate.

# Insights
The report comprising of different types of graphs has been created on Power BI Desktop application.
The following inferences can be established from the analysis of this report:
### 1. Ticket prices for first class cabins went as high as 512 pounds, whereas that of third class cabins went as low as 4 pounds.
### 2. Most passengers weren't being accompanied by many family members. In fact, only few passengers had more than 4 family members on-board with them.
### 3. The most common age range of Titanic passengers was 20-40, with 30 being the most common age.
### 4. Among the survivors, there were many more women passengers as compared to men passengers.
### 5. Passengers embarked from 3 locations- Southampton, Cherbourg and Queenstown. Most passengers boarded the Titanic in Southampton. On the other hand, very few passengers boarded in Queenstown.
### 6. In each of the 3 locations, maximum passengers belonged to the third class. However, in Cherbourg, interestingly there were more first class passengers than third class passengers.
